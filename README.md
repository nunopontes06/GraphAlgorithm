# Problem description
The problem concerns the coloration of adjacent flat regions. As with cartographic maps, it is necessary that, whatever colors are used, two adjacent regions must not have the same color. In other words, two regions are only considered adjacent when they share some line segment, as the map shows in the figure below.
The ideal way I found to solve the problem is not to have the same color in adjacent regions. For that, I chose to be inspired by the coloring algorithm taught in one of the discrete math classes, in the theoretical part.
